# Why ecologists should share their data

This repository contains the draft of paper which will be submitted for the special issue of [*Ideas in Ecology & Evolution* ](http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/IEE/announcement). The repository is open, so that you can read the paper, [tell me what you think of it](https://twitter.com/tpoi), and even fork it. I'm not at all against the idea of people spontaneously contributing!
